## 2026-10-12: Phase 3 audit fix: .gitignore
- Removed the `build/` rule. It blocked any folder named "build" anywhere (on a Mac even "Build"), which could hide real code. Built output is still ignored via `dist/` and `public/build/`.
- Why: found in the Phase 3 audit. [Our addition]
- Commit: (this save point)

## 2026-10-12: Step 3.7 Decisions summary
- Filled `docs/DECISIONS.md` with a short summary of the product decisions and assumptions.
- Why: the brief asks us to document assumptions. [Required by brief]
- Commit: 9eb6875

## 2026-10-12: Step 3.6 Logbook templates
- Added `docs/` with empty logbook files: changelog, decisions, mistakes, ideas and limitations, test log, product notes.
- Why: keep a short, honest record of the work as it happens. [Our addition]
- Commit: a336c1b

## 2026-10-11: Step 3.5 Template recreated
- Added the brief (`Readme.md`), the `files/` folder (mock Jamf data, reference sync code, wireframe, screenshot) and a `.gitignore`.
- Why: WorkWize's template link returned a 404, so the template was rebuilt from the email attachments. Files copied unchanged (checksums verified). [Required by brief]
- Commit: 3664be3
